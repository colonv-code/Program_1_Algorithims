    "The insertion sort seemed better especially in the cases where best O(n) time was possible. This is because insertion sort has the ability to stop early if the array is nearly or already sorted. This happens because the inner loop is comparing key with array element - no swaps will be made if already in order. However selection sort must always run the inner loop and check each element against all other elements in array to find if a swap needs to occur. \n",
